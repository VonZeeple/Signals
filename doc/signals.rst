How Signals works?
==================

Wires and Connectors
--------------------

To transmit signal bewteen two blocks, signal wires can be used. A wire can be attached to a connector with right-click. A dangling wire will appear between the connector and the player hand. The wire is placed once a second connector have been right-clicked. Changing item in hand will cancel the wire placement.


Signal strength
---------------

A signal can have a value between 0 and 15. Signal strengh can be decreased using a simply fixed resistor, or modulated using more complex circuitry.
